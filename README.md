**Pikuu** is a developer tool that generates production-ready backend and UI from a data schema or an initial idea, using an iterative chat-based workflow.

The app behaves as a technical assistant, not a generic generator: each user message updates only the requested part of the project while preserving global state.

It is fully focused on the modern **Next.js + TypeScript** stack.
